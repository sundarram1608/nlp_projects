This repository contains the assignments successfully completed as a part of course work of Masters in Information Science with emphasis on Machine Learning with University of Arizona. <br> The assignments include:<br>
- Text Preprocessing<br>
- Text Similarity<br>
- Text Classification<br>
- Sequence Processing<br>
- Pre Trained Language Model<br>

> Text Preprocessing<br>

This assignment includes text extraction, text cleaning, Tokenization and structuring the dataset.<br>
Libraries such as spacy, beautifulsoup, re & pandas are leveraged.<br>

> Text Similarity<br>

In this assignment, [Semantic Textual Similarity](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task1/) (STS) shared task organized within the 2017 editions of SemEval has been worked upon. The STS of sentence-pairs in English has been measured using Cosine Similarity and Word Mover's Distance. The task involved producing real-valued similarity scores ranging from 0 for complete dissimilar sentences to 5 for completely equivalent sentences, as can be seen in the following examples:

| Sentence 1                                              | Sentence 2                                            | Score |
| :---                                                    | :----                                                 | ---:  |
| The bird is bathing in the sink.                        | Birdie is washing itself in the water basin.          |   5   |
| John said he is considered a witness but not a suspect. | “He is not a suspect anymore.” John said.             |   3   |
| The black dog is running through the snow.              | A race car driver is driving his car through the mud. |   0   |

[gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), a **Python** library that provides functionality to obtain text representations based on word embeddings (GloVe) has been used to obtain the numerical text representations<br>

> Text Classification<br>

In this assignment, [OffensEval](https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/) shared task, a part of the 2019 and 2020 editions of SemEval has been worked upon. Offensive language identification (Offensive/ non-offensive) and Automatic categorization of offense types(targeted or not) has been classified

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a **Python** Machine Learning library is leveraged<br>
