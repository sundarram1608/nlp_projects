# Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment are to:

1. combine and pre-process two input texts for a text maching problem
2. combine and pre-process a context with several possible answers for a multiple choice problem
3. fine-tune pre-trained language models for both tasks

Graduate students will also acquire skills to implement an end-to-end solution based on pre-trained models for a sequence-to-sequence problem.
