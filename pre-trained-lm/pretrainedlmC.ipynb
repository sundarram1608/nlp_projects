    "# Pre-trained Language Models: SubTask C\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work on the [ComVE](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080) shared task that was part of SemEval-2020. The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask C**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a statement that does not make sense, generate the reason why this statement does not make sense. For each nonsensical statement, three valid reasons are given as reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "     *Statement*: He put an elephant into the fridge.  \n",
    "     *Reason A*: An elephant is much bigger than a fridge.  \n",
    "     *Reason B*: A fridge is much smaller than an elephant.  \n",
    "     *Reason C*: Most of the fridges aren't large enough to contain an elephant.\n",
    "\n",
    "     This subtask can be approached as a Sequence-to-Sequence problem where the input is the nonsensical statement and the output is a valid reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will fine-tune a Pre-trained Language Model with [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library that provides a set of tools for fine-tunning and deploying a wide variety of Pre-trained Language Models. The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) allows you to explore all the models supported by **Transformers** and even share your own models with the community. In this assignment, you will work with [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart), a pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Language Model usually requires a great amount of time and computational resources. Your personal computer will not be enough. In order to complete the assignment, you can work with a reduced version of the dataset and the base version of **BART**:"

This causes that different training runs of the same model can lead to different results.

    "In general, when using a `Trainer` to make predictions, it returns the logits for each class in the task. However, the `Seq2SeqTrainingArguments` class provides an option that allows the `Trainer` to generate sequences of tokens in the prediction. The `create_training_arguments` function must create the `Seq2SeqTrainingArguments` with that option and the hyperparamters passed as arguments. During the training, the model must be evaluated on the development set after every epoch. `TrainingArguments` should include this strategy.\n",
